        <p>A thing I noticed working day by day on <a href="https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/tree/master/data">WPScan's vulnerability database</a> is that many of the Wordpress (plugins) vulns disclosed are far less than the actual number of exploitable plugins. 
A quick trip on the <a href="https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/tree/master/data">official directory</a> and a little browsing over the svn repositories will point out a lot of trivial bugs which might be worth an advisory. I am talking about low hanging fruits like unsophisticated xss and basic sqli.</p>
<p>For example some time ago we were debunking a fake advisory with <a href="http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk">Ryan</a> and we found out a bunch of xss on the very same plugin just by running <a href="http://www.devbug.co.uk">DevBug</a> (which was not optimized for Wordpress code). There is a gold mine of easy bugs down there.</p>
<p>The hassle is that properly disclosing a vuln takes a lot of time: you should find it, test it, warn the author, warn Automattic, and publish an advisory. If you find an unresponsive author it may take up to a month and meanwhile an horde of new plugins are published. We can't keep up and most of the time it's not worth it.</p>
<p>And what if down the mine there is a true gem nobody knows yet? What if it's first found by someone with malicious intents? That's <em>the</em> problem: a vuln exploited before the advisory. And WPscan relies on advisories as it's main source of data. You do the math.</p>
<p>Having fresh data is crucial: from a defensive stand point an average Wordpress user should care far more about actively exploited vulns than random bugs on his installed plugins. In the end if a vulnerability is not exploited it's not a real menace (just a potential one). For example I personally like how recurrently a vulnerable timthumb file is found inside a plugin and a wave of wild exploitation arise. </p>
<p>To cath those attacks the approach is standard: honeypots.</p>
<p>This should also be how many commercial appsec vendors like SpiderLabs and Sucuri are detecting attacks. SpiderLabs <a href="http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2011/11/wordpress-timthumb-attacks-rising.html">seems</a> to have a web app honeypot (general purpose? Wordpress specific?) while at Sucuri they might just monitor their client's Wordpress installations since they seems to have a large wordpress-centric user base. </p>
<p>I am just speculating since <strong>nobody is kind enough to share their secrets</strong>. The best tool available so far is <a href="http://glastopf.org">Glastopf</a> which is general purpose and quite useless in our case.</p>
<p>So to cope with the loss of proper tools I've built a Wordpress honeypot from scratch in the hope to catch some exploitation and provide the WPScan project with fresh data. It's called <a href="/g/projects/wordpot.html">wordpot</a> and is public domain.</p>
<p>If you were thinking about <a href="http://wpscan.org">contributing to WPScan</a> in a way or another starting now you can also help by installing wordpot and let us know how it goes. </p>
